Most of the assignments of the 42 school were about reacreating already existent functions of C libraries. 
The most advanced project i worked on was Libft.
Thats the first project of the main course.
As the name suggests it is a project with a goal to create your own library of functions.
Everything else in my Github is pretty basic assignements from the 42 school selection proccess (Piscine)
